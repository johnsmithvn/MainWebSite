## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Backend server running on port 3000

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env.local` file for local development:
   ```env
   VITE_DISABLE_STRICT_MODE=false
   VITE_BASE=/
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## 🔧 Configuration

### Vite Configuration
The app uses Vite with React plugin and includes:
- Path aliases (`@` points to `src/`)
- Proxy configuration for backend API calls
- Production build optimization

### TailwindCSS Configuration
Custom theme extensions include:
- Primary and dark color palettes
- Custom animations (fade-in, slide-up, scale-in)
- Aspect ratios for media content
- Responsive breakpoints

### API Proxy Setup
Development server proxies API calls to backend:
- `/api/*` → `http://localhost:3000`
- `/manga/*` → `http://localhost:3000`
- `/video/*` → `http://localhost:3000`
- `/audio/*` → `http://localhost:3000`
