## [Unreleased]

### 🎉 Completed

- ✅ [2025-01-05] **SETTINGS REFACTOR - FULLY COMPLETED** - Hoàn thành 100% refactor Settings với FULL functionality
  - **Problem**: Settings page chỉ có 2/7 tabs working (Appearance, General), 5 tabs còn lại hiển thị "coming soon"
  - **Root Cause**: Phase 1 chỉ tạo UI structure mà không migrate business logic từ Settings.jsx.backup
  - **Solution**: Extracted logic từ backup file (1,454 lines) và tách thành 5 component files mới
  - **Created Files**:
    - `CacheSettings.jsx` (650 lines) - Cache management cho Manga/Movie/Music với 4 levels: Root, Source, Source+Storage, All
    - `MediaSettings.jsx` (200 lines) - Database operations, manga reader settings, quality settings
    - `AccountSettings.jsx` (60 lines) - User authentication management
    - `PrivacySettings.jsx` (50 lines) - Analytics và error reporting controls
    - `AboutSettings.jsx` (70 lines) - App info, version, credits, tech stack
  - **Updated**: `settings/index.jsx` - Import all 5 components và thay thế placeholders

  - **Quality**: Zero compilation errors, modular architecture maintained
  - **User Impact**: Settings page giờ có đầy đủ chức năng như ban đầu (cache clear, database ops, media settings)

### 🎉 Completed

- ✅ [2025-01-05] **CRITICAL FIX - Settings Modal Component** - Fixed undefined component error
  - **Issue**: `ModalComponent` was undefined causing React render error at line 292

  - **Fixed**: Changed destructure from `ModalComponent` to `Modal` in settings/index.jsx
  - **Impact**: Settings page now renders without errors
  - **Files Modified**: `pages/settings/index.jsx` (2 lines)

  - **Components Fixed** (6 files): MusicPlayer, MusicPlayerV2, PlayerFooter, PlayerHeader, UniversalCard, SearchModal
  - **Enhanced thumbnailProcessor**: Added manga/comic support (previously only movie/music)
  - **Result**: Tất cả components giờ dùng unified `thumbnailProcessor` utility
  - **Quality**: Zero compilation errors, consistent logic across codebase
  - **Deprecated**: `thumbnailUtils.js` no longer used, can be removed
  - **See**: `react-app/refactor/IMPORT-CHECK-REPORT.md` for detailed analysis

- ✅ [2025-01-05] **PHASE 1 REFACTORING - 100% COMPLETE** - Hoàn tất tái cấu trúc Phase 1

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (New)

- � [2025-09-13] Sửa lỗi import trong RecentSlider.jsx bị hỏng
  - Sửa lỗi import `embla-carousel-autoplay` bị hỏng gây lỗi khi khởi chạy ứng dụng
  - Dòng import có chứa JSX của component nằm trong tên module bị import

- �🔄 [2025-09-13] Tối ưu khoảng cách giữa các thành phần UI - giảm khoảng trống
  - Giảm padding tổng thể của trang xuống còn p-1 sm:p-2 thay vì p-3 sm:p-6
  - Giảm khoảng cách giữa các slider từ space-y-6 xuống space-y-1
  - Giảm margin-bottom của các container slider xuống mb-1 sm:mb-1
  - Giảm padding nội dung của các container xuống p-2 sm:p-3
  - Tinh chỉnh padding của header trong slider xuống p-2 sm:p-3 pb-1 sm:pb-2
  - Tăng không gian hiển thị nội dung bằng cách tối ưu khoảng trắng

- 🔄 [2025-09-13] Đồng bộ hóa width giữa slider và grid view - cân bằng UI
  - Áp dụng padding thống nhất cho container chứa MangaRandomSection và grid view
  - Xóa bỏ margin 0.5rem thừa trong .embla CSS để đảm bảo cân bằng với grid view
  - Đồng bộ max-width giữa slider và grid view

- 🔄 [2025-09-13] Giảm chiều cao tổng thể sliders (Random/Recent/TopView) – áp dụng variant `compact-slider` & loại bỏ padding đáy
  - Áp dụng variant mới `compact-slider` (padding nhỏ, font-size giảm, metadata tối giản) cho cả 3 slider thay cho `compact`/`slider`
  - Loại bỏ `<div className="pb-2" />` đáy các slider (thừa sau khi tinh chỉnh dots & spacing) giúp giảm ~16px chiều cao mỗi section
  - Giảm chiều cao card => wrapper bớt "dài", tăng mật độ thông tin trên màn hình nhỏ
  - Không thay đổi logic dữ liệu; chỉ tác động presentation nên rủi ro thấp
  - Chuẩn bị cho bước tiếp theo nếu cần thêm `density` prop tuỳ biến trong tương lai
  - Bổ sung chống tràn 1px: bỏ padding ngang trong `.embla`, ép overflow-hidden trên Recent/TopView wrapper & trừ 0.2px trong công thức width để khử rounding dư

- 🐛 [2025-09-13] Fixed slider hiển thị vượt viewport gây scroll ngang – áp dụng giải pháp triệt để theo phân tích cấu trúc:
  - Xác định nguyên nhân gốc: width tổng chính xác trong container, flex gap, card layout overflow
  - Áp dụng container width `calc(100vw - 32px)` với margin thay padding để đảm bảo không tràn
  - Chặn scroll `overflow-hidden` và force `w-full` trên tất cả container
  - Giảm breakpoint max-width slides xuống (nhỏ hơn 135px mobile), tăng padding
  - Loại bỏ translate 3D và GPU accelerated classes không cần thiết
  - Thêm `w-full` cho tất cả container slider để fit parent container
  - Thay công thức width cũ `calc(% - gap)` (gây sai số + overflow) bằng công thức phân bố: `(100% - (n-1)*gap)/n` với biến `--slides-per-view-*`
  - Di chuyển horizontal padding từ `.embla__container` lên `.embla` để không cộng dồn vào tổng chiều rộng flex container
  - Chuẩn hóa biến: `--slides-per-view-mobile|tablet|desktop|large` giúp điều chỉnh số cột dễ dàng về sau
  - Tăng gap rõ ràng (0.25rem mobile / 0.5rem desktop) đồng nhất thay vì trừ thủ công trong width
  - Loại bỏ hover scale trực tiếp trên slide (chuyển sang translateY nhẹ) tránh làm “nhô” ra ngoài ở slide cuối
  - Giảm transform lan truyền gây sub‑pixel rounding khi `dragFree + trimSnaps` hoạt động
  - Thêm `will-change: transform` cho ảnh trong `UniversalCard` tối ưu hiệu ứng nhưng không nở rộng layout
  - Kết quả: Không còn viền tràn 1–2px ở cạnh phải trên mobile/desktop, snap ổn định hơn, dễ bảo trì
  - Điều chỉnh bổ sung: tăng `--slides-per-view-mobile` 3→4, giới hạn `max-width` slide (180px mobile, 220px desktop lớn) để tránh card phóng quá khổ khi màn hình hẹp nhưng density thấp
  - Tối ưu sizing lần 2 (2025-09-13):
    - Mobile dynamic density:  <390px = 4 cột, ≥390px = 5 cột, ≥480px = 6 cột
    - Giảm tiếp max-width: 150px mobile, 200px desktop lớn
    - Bỏ `max-width:100vw` → dùng `100%` tránh kéo theo scrollbar width
    - Thêm `overflow-x:hidden` toàn cục chặn rounding leak

### Fixed

- �🐛 [2025-09-13] Improved CSS maintainability with custom properties → Applied Copilot suggestions for better code organization
  - Extracted repetitive calc() expressions to CSS custom properties for slide widths
  - Applied consistent gap values (0.17rem) across all breakpoints instead of mixing 0.25rem and 0.5rem
  - Created reusable CSS variables: --slide-width-mobile, --slide-width-tablet, --slide-width-desktop, --slide-width-large
  - Eliminated code duplication and improved maintainability as suggested by Copilot AI

- � [2025-09-13] Fixed slider viewport overflow issue → Applied Copilot suggestions for better CSS maintainability

  - Badge spacing: Tighter space-x-2 on mobile for better layout density
  - All slider headers now use responsive breakpoint strategy: base mobile → sm → md → lg

### Changed

- � [2025-09-13] Giảm chiều cao tổng thể sliders (Random/Recent/TopView) – áp dụng variant `compact-slider` & loại bỏ padding đáy
  - Áp dụng variant mới `compact-slider` (padding nhỏ, font-size giảm, metadata tối giản) cho cả 3 slider thay cho `compact`/`slider`
  - Loại bỏ `<div className="pb-2" />` đáy các slider (thừa sau khi tinh chỉnh dots & spacing) giúp giảm ~16px chiều cao mỗi section
  - Giảm chiều cao card => wrapper bớt “dài”, tăng mật độ thông tin trên màn hình nhỏ
  - Không thay đổi logic dữ liệu; chỉ tác động presentation nên rủi ro thấp
  - Chuẩn bị cho bước tiếp theo nếu cần thêm `density` prop tuỳ biến trong tương lai
  - Bổ sung chống tràn 1px: bỏ padding ngang trong `.embla`, ép overflow-hidden trên Recent/TopView wrapper & trừ 0.2px trong công thức width để khử rounding dư

## 5.0.1 - 2025-08-24

- Backend: Mở rộng CORS để cho phép origin từ Tailscale (*.ts.net) trong môi trường development, thêm header `x-secure-token` vào danh sách allowedHeaders để tránh lỗi preflight khi React gửi kèm token.
- Backend: Đọc `CORS_EXTRA_ORIGINS` từ `.env` để whitelist các origin bổ sung (ví dụ domain Tailscale cụ thể).
- React (Vite): Bật `server.host=true` để lắng nghe 0.0.0.0, cố định cổng và thêm cấu hình HMR qua biến môi trường `VITE_HMR_HOST`/`VITE_HMR_PORT` cho truy cập qua domain Tailscale. Thêm `server.allowedHosts` (bao gồm regex `*.ts.net` và biến `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`) để tránh lỗi "This host is not allowed" của Vite khi truy cập bằng domain Tailscale.
- Ghi chú: 3000 tiếp tục phục vụ frontend tĩnh; 3001 chạy React dev app, API được proxy về 3000.
